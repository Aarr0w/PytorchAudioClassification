# PytorchAudioClassification

Notebooks from the introductory Pytorch tutorial series:
Audio Classification in Pytorch

Part 1 (minimal_pytorch): A tiny PyTorch project with a toy mathematical function as the dataset. Perfect if you've never touched ML /Pytorch before! 

Part 2 (Audio Classification from csv): Building a model that can recognize different music genres. A straightforward introduction to Pytorch dataset class and using pandas dataframes

Part 3 (Audio Classification from spectrograms): The fun stuff! Audio processing with pictures. - Taking raw audio files, converting them to spectrograms, creating a custom dataset class and fine-tuning a pretrained network (VGG-19)

These files are meant to be run via Google Colab, for easiest execution
